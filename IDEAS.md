# MobSteroids ideas

- [ ] Item to buff mobs (make them bigger).
- [ ] Item to shrink mobs (make them smaller).
- [ ] Item to change mob drop chance (luck/fortune).
- [ ] Item to change mob drop.
    - Using this item has a chance to change the mob's drop.
    - Choosing a rare drop could have negative effects on the mob (could die if too small, explode if item too rare for its size, negative potion effects).
- [ ] Item to add passive dropping (like chickens).
    - Mob *will get* negative effects to balance based on the item's rarity.
- [ ] Item to make a mob a companion (like a leash).

Health, strength, speed, loot scale with the mob's size.
Bigger mobs should have louder sounds and obviously larger bounding boxes.
Mob has to have a certain size for a certain time before changing stats (to balance)?
