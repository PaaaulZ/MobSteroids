# MobSteroids
A Minecraft mod to buff mobs and make animals more "interesting"

**This is not a finished product. The last mod I made was for Minecraft 1.2.5, I'm just trying to better understand forge by making a mod. Sorry if you came here thinking you could download and play this mod.**

## CONCEPT

The idea for this mod is to make animals and mobs more useful and fun. In theory when finished this will let you inflate or shrink mobs other than buff them (make them stronger, faster, drop more stuff, drop stuff passively, remove negative traits, ecc.). For example you could have a gigantic cow in your farm with no cooldown after milking, a gigantic pig that you can harvest meat from without dying and other weird stuff.
